                <li>The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Super is the best bang for buck, pound for pound champion, gaming GPU on the market currently</li>
                <li>If money is not an issue and you want the most powerful gaming GPU currently available, look no further than the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090</li>
                <li>The Radeon RX 7900 XTX comes in many different flavors and board partners and while not the most powerful or cheapest GPU, it's still a very high performing and worthy competitor</li>
                <li>May want to wait it out a few more months for the release of the newest iteration of the NVIDIA RTX series as the highly anticipated GeForce RTX 5090 will likely be the new sheriff in town for many years to come</li>
